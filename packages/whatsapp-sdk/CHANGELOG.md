# Changelog

All notable changes to `@dojocoding/whatsapp-sdk` (formerly
`@dojocoding/whatsapp`) are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Pre-1.0 minor versions may contain breaking changes — see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) § Releases.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-12

V1 runway — the final 0.x minor bundles three changes Site2Print
identified as Phase A blockers in the integration audit. All three
land together so consumers see one upgrade.

OpenSpec changes:

- `2026-05-12-web-adapter-waituntil`
- `2026-05-12-webhook-ctwa-clid`
- `2026-05-12-rename-idempotency-to-request-id`

### Added — `waitUntil` on the web adapter

`CreateWhatsAppHandlerOptions.waitUntil?: (p: Promise<unknown>) => void`
on the Fetch-API adapter at `@dojocoding/whatsapp-sdk/web`. Wires the
SDK's async dispatch promise into runtime lifecycle-extension APIs
(Vercel Functions `@vercel/functions.waitUntil`, Cloudflare Workers
`ctx.waitUntil`) so handlers actually run on serverless / edge
runtimes.

Without this, the fire-and-forget dispatch promise was silently
dropped after the response on Vercel + Workers — handlers never
finished, DB writes never landed, OTel spans never flushed. Now:

```ts
// Vercel Functions:
import { waitUntil } from "@vercel/functions";
const handler = createWhatsAppHandler(receiver, { waitUntil });

// Cloudflare Workers:
const handler = createWhatsAppHandler(receiver, {
  waitUntil: ctx.waitUntil.bind(ctx),
});
```

When omitted, behaviour is unchanged (fire-and-forget). The adapter
chains `.catch(onUnhandledHandlerError)` BEFORE passing the promise
to `waitUntil`, so the runtime never sees an unhandled rejection.

5 new contract tests in
`packages/whatsapp-sdk/test/contract/adapters/web/wait-until.test.ts`.

### Added — `MessageEvent.referral` for CTWA attribution

When Meta attaches a `referral` object to the first inbound message
after a Click-to-WhatsApp ad click, the SDK's parser now surfaces it
on the parsed `MessageEvent`:

```ts
import type { MessageEvent, WhatsAppReferral } from "@dojocoding/whatsapp-sdk";

receiver.on("message", (e: MessageEvent) => {
  if (e.referral?.ctwa_clid) {
    // forward to Meta CAPI for ad attribution
  }
});
```

The new `WhatsAppReferral` type names the documented core fields
(`ctwa_clid`, `source_url`, `source_type`, `source_id`, `headline`,
`body`, `media_type`, `media_url`, `thumbnail_url`,
`welcome_message`). The runtime type is a permissive intersection
with `Record<string, unknown>` — unknown future fields Meta adds
are preserved without an SDK release.

Attribution semantics:

- Only the **first** message after a click carries `referral`.
  Subsequent messages don't; cache `ctwa_clid` keyed on `from`.
- Empty `referral: {}` is preserved (distinguishes "no referral"
  from "referral present but Meta omitted details").
- The parser does NOT throw on a non-object / null `referral`.

6 new tests + 2 fixtures
(`message-with-ctwa-referral.json`, `message-with-empty-referral.json`).

### BREAKING (pre-1.0 minor) — `idempotencyKey` → `requestId` rename

The misleading "idempotency" naming on the request-correlation
surface is renamed:

- `RequestOptions.idempotencyKey` → `RequestOptions.requestId`
- Outbound header `X-Dojo-Idempotency-Key` → `X-Request-Id`
- OTel span attribute `whatsapp.idempotency_key` → `whatsapp.request.id`

Behaviour is unchanged — the SDK still generates a UUID v4 per
logical call when `requestId` is omitted, still reuses it across
retry attempts, still attaches the header to every outbound
request. Only the naming changes.

**Why:** Meta does NOT consult any SDK-attached header for outbound
deduplication. The `X-Dojo-Idempotency-Key` naming created a
false-positive feeling for consumers who assumed retries were
deduplicated server-side. The v0.x → v1.0 window is the right
moment to clean this up. Real outbound dedup is post-1.0 (the
`outbound-deduper` capability on the v2 roadmap).

**Migration:** mechanical search-and-replace. See
[`MIGRATION.md`](../../MIGRATION.md) § "SDK: 0.8.x → 1.0.0".

```diff
- await client.sendText({ to, body }, { idempotencyKey: "booking-123" });
+ await client.sendText({ to, body }, { requestId: "booking-123" });
```

Downstream consumers reading `req.idempotencyKey` in custom retry
hooks, or asserting the legacy header / span attribute in tests,
break at compile or assertion time. Renames in one shot.

### Docs

- `docs/sdk/web.md` § "Cloudflare Workers" and "Next.js App Router
  (Vercel)" updated with the `waitUntil` wiring. Long-lived vs
  serverless / edge threading model called out explicitly.
- `docs/sdk/webhooks.md` § "Click-to-WhatsApp (CTWA) referral" — new
  subsection with the Meta CAPI handoff snippet + attribution caveats.
- `docs/sdk/patterns.md` § 7 renamed and rewritten: "Request
  correlation with `requestId`" (was "Replay-safe sends with
  `idempotencyKey`"). Honest framing — correlation, not dedup.
- `docs/architecture.md` § "Idempotency hint" replaced with
  "Request correlation" naming the new header + attribute and
  pointing at the v2 `outbound-deduper` for real dedup.
- `docs/compliance.md` § 3.4 updated with the rename and the v2
  outbound-deduper roadmap note.
- `MIGRATION.md` § "SDK: 0.8.x → 1.0.0" gains the `requestId` rename
  diff alongside the existing `setRedactSalt` deprecation entry.

### Tests

- 5 new web-adapter `waitUntil` contract tests.
- 6 new CTWA / referral parser tests.
- 1 new test asserting the legacy `X-Dojo-Idempotency-Key` header
  is NOT emitted (alongside the renamed-name tests).

603 SDK tests (was 591). Coverage 97.38 / 88.88 / 99.15 / 97.38 —
well above the 90/85/90/90 gate.

## [0.8.3] — 2026-05-11

V1 runway: scope the OTel PII hashing salt to the client/receiver
instance instead of relying on a process-wide setter.

### Added

- **`WhatsAppClientOptions.redactSalt?: string`** — per-client
  salt used by the SDK's OTel span PII hashing
  (`whatsapp.phone_number_id`, `whatsapp.waba_id`, etc.). When
  set, every span attribute hashed from this client uses this
  salt regardless of any process-wide override. Multi-tenant
  deployments should set this on every client so spans from
  different WABAs cannot be cross-correlated by hash prefix.
- **`WebhookReceiverOptions.redactSalt?: string`** — same
  contract for the webhook receiver's span pipeline.
- **`hashPhoneNumberId(value, salt?)`** — optional second
  argument lets custom `WhatsAppLikeClient` wrappers and
  consumer-side tracing code thread their own salt through.
- **`WhatsAppLikeClient.redactSalt?: string`** — optional
  interface member so wrappers (`withRateLimit`, the
  consent-broadcast pattern in `docs/cookbook/hybrid/`) can
  propagate the underlying client's salt without dipping
  into the concrete `WhatsAppClient` type.
- **`DEFAULT_REDACT_SALT`** — exported constant for the
  dev-default fallback value.

### Deprecated

- **`setRedactSalt(...)`** — the process-wide setter is now
  deprecated. It continues to work through the entire 1.x
  line as a fallback for callers that don't supply a per-call
  or per-client salt, but the **constructor option is the v1
  preferred path**. The setter is removed in v2.0.0.

  Migration is one line per client:

  ```diff
  - setRedactSalt(process.env.OBSERVABILITY_SALT!);
  - const client = new WhatsAppClient({ phoneNumberId, wabaId, token, appSecret });
  + const client = new WhatsAppClient({
  +   phoneNumberId, wabaId, token, appSecret,
  +   redactSalt: process.env.OBSERVABILITY_SALT,
  + });
  ```

  See [`../../MIGRATION.md`](../../MIGRATION.md) for the full
  v0.x → v1.x upgrade path.

### Tests

- 6 new tests in `test/unit/observability/redact.test.ts`
  covering per-call salt precedence, salt stability,
  default-salt fallback, and the `DEFAULT_REDACT_SALT` constant.
  591 SDK tests (was 586).

## [0.8.2] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- **`WhatsAppLikeClient.healthCheck?` — optional method on the
  integration interface.** Mirrors the `healthCheck` method on
  `WhatsAppClient` that was always there but missing from the
  interface (a drift caught by the new client-interface drift
  detector). Marked **optional** so existing consumer wrappers
  that implement `WhatsAppLikeClient` continue to compile
  without changes; new wrappers should add a one-line delegation
  (`healthCheck: (opts) => this.inner.healthCheck(opts)`) if
  they want to intercept startup health-checks.
- **`MockWhatsAppClient.healthCheck()` — synthetic implementation.**
  Returns `{ valid: true, expiresAt: null, appId: null, userId: null, scopes: [] }`.
  Lets tests that need a `WhatsAppLikeClient` exposing the full
  surface (consent-broadcast pattern + similar wrappers) use the
  mock without stubbing.

### Tests

- **New client-interface drift detector** at
  `packages/whatsapp-sdk/test/contract/client-interface-drift.test.ts`.
  Compares `WhatsAppClient.prototype` and
  `MockWhatsAppClient.prototype` at runtime to catch:
  - Public methods on the real client absent from the mock.
  - Methods on the mock absent from the real client.
  - Stale allow-list entries.
  - The specific `healthCheck` drift this release fixes.
- Three targeted high-value branch tests across the SDK
  (templates/validate.ts edge cases + queue/with-rate-limit.ts
  send-method coverage + mock/client.ts sendContacts /
  sendInteractive / sendDocument / sendSticker happy paths)
  shipped in the prior commit; coverage is now 97.4 / 88.8 /
  99.1 / 97.4 (statements / branches / functions / lines).

581 → 586 SDK tests.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-11

### Changed (rename completion + docs polish)

Track G — finishing the `0.8.0` rename. Two leftover stable
identifiers inside the SDK still self-identified under the old
name; we update them now so the SDK is internally consistent
post-rename.

- **OpenTelemetry `TRACER_NAME`** in
  `packages/whatsapp-sdk/src/observability/tracing.ts` is now
  `"@dojocoding/whatsapp-sdk"` (was `"@dojocoding/whatsapp"`).
  Any observability dashboard filtering on the SDK's
  `instrumentationScope.name` needs to update its query. Hot
  paths and span attribute names are unchanged.
- **Default `redactSalt`** in
  `packages/whatsapp-sdk/src/observability/redact.ts` is now
  `"@dojocoding/whatsapp-sdk:dev-default-salt"` (was
  `"@dojocoding/whatsapp:dev-default-salt"`). The salt is
  documented as dev-default and production deployments are
  expected to override via `setRedactSalt()`. If you rely on
  hash-replay against the old default in tests, also pass
  the old string explicitly to `setRedactSalt(...)` for the
  duration of the migration.
- **JSDoc and inline comments** in the adapter source files
  updated to reference `@dojocoding/whatsapp-sdk` and its
  subpaths (`/express`, `/web`, `/hono`).

### Docs (no runtime change beyond the above)

- `docs/sdk/*.md` (14 reference pages) bulk-renamed to the new
  package name and subpaths; `src/` references rebased to
  `packages/whatsapp-sdk/src/`.
- SDK cookbook recipes (`docs/cookbook/sdk/*.md`) gained
  "Agent variant" / "See also (hybrid)" footers pointing at the
  matching `docs/cookbook/hybrid/` and `docs/cookbook/mcp/`
  recipes where the LLM-driven version of the same pattern
  lives.
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` rewritten to be
  workspace-aware (both packages, per-package CHANGELOGs,
  `pnpm -r` commands, tag-prefix release convention).
- `docs/compliance.md` and `docs/compatibility.md` got
  cross-cutting sections covering the MCP server's invariants +
  MCP host compatibility (Claude Desktop / Agent SDK / Cursor /
  Cline).

572 tests still pass.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-10

### Renamed: `@dojocoding/whatsapp` → `@dojocoding/whatsapp-sdk`

This release renames the package to match the new two-package
architecture (`@dojocoding/whatsapp-sdk` + the new sibling
[`@dojocoding/whatsapp-mcp`](../whatsapp-mcp/CHANGELOG.md), which
exposes the SDK's outbound surface as a Model Context Protocol
server for LLM agents).

**Zero runtime change.** The 572-test suite passes verbatim
against `0.7.4`'s public surface. No symbol renames, no type
changes, no behaviour change.

**Migration — one line of `package.json`:**

```diff
   "dependencies": {
-    "@dojocoding/whatsapp": "^0.7.0"
+    "@dojocoding/whatsapp-sdk": "^0.8.0"
   }
```

…plus a project-wide find-and-replace on import statements:

```diff
- import { WhatsAppClient } from "@dojocoding/whatsapp";
+ import { WhatsAppClient } from "@dojocoding/whatsapp-sdk";
```

…and equivalent updates for subpath imports (`/express`,
`/web`, `/hono`, `/storage/redis`, `/storage/postgres`).

The old `@dojocoding/whatsapp` package is `npm deprecate`-d with
a redirect message; the 13 published versions (0.1.0–0.7.4)
stay installable for pinned consumers.

### Repo structure (no consumer-visible change)

- The repo is now a `pnpm` workspace. SDK code lives under
  `packages/whatsapp-sdk/`; the new MCP server lives under
  `packages/whatsapp-mcp/`.
- Tag prefixes disambiguate release targets in CI:
  `sdk-v0.x.x` for this package, `mcp-v0.x.x` for the MCP
  sibling. The legacy `v0.x.x` prefix retires with this
  release.
- Docs reorganise under repo-root `docs/` with `sdk/`, `mcp/`,
  and `cookbook/{sdk,mcp,hybrid}/` subtrees. The
  [`hybrid/`](../../docs/cookbook/hybrid/) cookbook (lands in
  Phase C3) is the showcase for using both packages together.

See OpenSpec change
[`2026-05-10-add-mcp-server`](../../openspec/changes/2026-05-10-add-mcp-server/)
for the full rationale.

## [0.7.4] — 2026-05-10

### Tooling (no SDK behaviour change)

Phase 4 of the Track F + test-coverage audit hardening pass. The
published artefact is functionally identical to 0.7.3; only the
build / CI tooling and CHANGELOG differ.

- **Bundle-size budgets (F6).** `size-limit` is wired into CI with
  per-entry-point budgets defined in `package.json`:

  | Entry point                             | Budget |
  | --------------------------------------- | ------ |
  | `@dojocoding/whatsapp` (root, ESM/CJS)  | 100 KB |
  | `@dojocoding/whatsapp/express`          | 6 KB   |
  | `@dojocoding/whatsapp/web`              | 3 KB   |
  | `@dojocoding/whatsapp/hono`             | 3 KB   |
  | `@dojocoding/whatsapp/storage/redis`    | 2 KB   |
  | `@dojocoding/whatsapp/storage/postgres` | 4 KB   |

  Limits are roughly 1.5× the current measured sizes, so a single PR
  cannot double a bundle by accident (e.g. an accidental
  `import "lodash"`). Run `pnpm size` locally to see the same
  budget report CI runs.

## [0.7.3] — 2026-05-10

### Tests (no SDK behaviour change)

Phase 3 of the Track F + test-coverage audit hardening pass.
572 tests pass (was 524 — +48 across the seven audit items below).
The published artefact is functionally identical to 0.7.2; only the
test suite and CHANGELOG differ.

- **Property-based assertions** with `fast-check` for three
  high-leverage modules:
  - `webhooks/signature.ts` — HMAC verifier invariants across
    random body / secret / header inputs.
  - `webhooks/dedupe.ts` — dedupe-key identity + Unicode handling.
  - `client/retry.ts` — `fullJitterDelay` math bounded by
    `[floorMs, min(maxDelayMs, expCap)]` for any RNG output.
- **Concurrent dedupe race test** — 100 parallel `handlePayload`
  calls with the same wamid invoke the handler exactly once;
  validates the single-flight semantics under Meta's aggressive
  retry pattern.
- **Storage failure propagation** — explicit assertions that
  `WebhookDeduper`, `WindowTracker`, and `WebhookReceiver`
  surface storage errors rather than swallowing them silently.
- **`sendReply` template-path coverage** — the window-exempt path
  for template + reaction payloads through `sendReply`, plus the
  window-gated path for free-form payloads, all asserted against
  captured wire bodies.
- **Local pack-contents smoke** — `test/contract/pack-contents.test.ts`
  mirrors the CI "Verify pack contents (dry-run)" assertion so
  `pnpm test` catches a `files` allowlist regression before CI.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-05-11

### Changed (CI / repo hygiene only — no SDK behaviour change)

- Dependabot now opens grouped weekly PRs for npm + GitHub Actions
  updates. `@types/*`, lint/format tooling, vitest/msw, and the
  `@opentelemetry/*` family ship as batched sweeps. Major-version
  bumps to peer-dep ecosystems (express, hono, ioredis, pg) are
  ignored — those need an explicit decision about widening the
  supported range.
- CodeQL static-analysis workflow added (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`)
  with the `security-extended` query suite. Runs on push, PR, and
  a weekly Monday schedule. Findings appear in the Security tab.
- `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=moderate` runs on every CI build
  (continue-on-error initially, so advisories surface in the run
  log without blocking PRs).
- PR template + three issue templates (bug, feature, compliance
  drift) shipped. `.github/CODEOWNERS` pins compliance-relevant
  files and the release pipeline.

No npm-published artefact changes from 0.7.1.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- **`verifySignatureOrThrow(input)`** — throwing variant of
  `verifySignature` exported from the root entry. Resolves silently
  on a valid signature; throws `WebhookSignatureError` on bad HMAC,
  missing header, malformed hex, or wrong byte length. Use this when
  wiring your own HTTP layer (not the SDK's Express / web / Hono
  adapters) and you want a typed error rather than a boolean.

### Changed

- **CI: bumped GitHub Actions to Node 24-compatible versions** —
  `actions/checkout@v5`, `actions/setup-node@v6`,
  `pnpm/action-setup@v6`, `actions/upload-artifact@v7`,
  `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`. Removes the deprecation banner
  on every CI run; ready for Meta's 2026-06-02 Node 20 default
  removal.

### Tests

- Added `test/contract/public-surface.test.ts` — a drift detector
  asserting every documented value/class/factory across the root
  entry and all five subpaths (`/express`, `/web`, `/hono`,
  `/storage/redis`, `/storage/postgres`) is reachable at runtime.
  If a sub-module export is added without being plumbed through, or
  a documented export is accidentally renamed/removed, this test
  fails before consumers do.
- Added negative-path coverage for `WebhookSignatureError` (5 new
  tests via `verifySignatureOrThrow`) and `MockModeError` (4 new
  contract tests pinning the public shape).
- Re-shimmed `test/integration/express/middleware.test.ts` to use a
  Promise-resolved-by-handler pattern instead of 5 ms `setTimeout`
  waits and wall-clock ack-timing windows — mirrors the
  determinism fix already applied to the web adapter test in 0.2.0.

524 tests pass (was 447).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Authentication template (OTP) builder.** `buildAuthTemplate({
to, name, language, otp, otpButtonIndex? })` and the matching
  `client.sendAuthTemplate(...)` produce the documented copy-code /
  one-tap / zero-tap wire payload with the OTP code duplicated into
  both the body and URL-button parameters (the canonical footgun
  this builder exists to remove). OTP length validated against
  Meta's 15-char ceiling.
- **Voice-note builder.** `buildVoice({ to, id|link })` and
  `client.sendVoice(...)` produce audio messages with `voice: true`,
  triggering transcription support, auto-download, and the "played"
  delivery status.
- **Carousel-template builder.** `buildCarouselTemplate({ to, name,
language, bodyParameters?, cards })` and
  `client.sendCarouselTemplate(...)` produce media-card carousel
  template sends with 1–10 cards. Each card's `card_index` is
  computed from iteration order; consumers can't misorder it.
- **Limited-time-offer template support.** Three new
  `TemplateParameter` union variants:
  `TemplateParameterLimitedTimeOffer`,
  `TemplateParameterCouponCode`, and `TemplateParameterPayload`.
  `TemplateComponent.type` widens to accept `"carousel"` and
  `"limited_time_offer"`. Use via the existing `buildTemplate(...)`
  /
  `client.sendTemplate(...)`.
- New `CarouselCardComponent` exported type. `AudioMessage.audio`
  gains an optional `voice?: boolean` field.

Every wire shape is grounded in a Meta doc URL referenced in
source-file JSDoc and pinned via byte-for-byte snapshot tests:

- https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/authentication-templates/copy-code-button-authentication-templates/
- https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messages/audio-messages
- https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/marketing-templates/media-card-carousel-templates/
- https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/marketing-templates/limited-time-offer-templates/

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Redis and Postgres `Storage` adapters at subpath exports.**
  - `@dojocoding/whatsapp/storage/redis` exports
    `createRedisStorage(client, options?)`. Takes an
    `ioredis`-compatible client; uses native `SET PX` / `SET NX`
    for TTL and atomicity. `ioredis` is an optional peer
    dependency on `^5.0.0`.
  - `@dojocoding/whatsapp/storage/postgres` exports
    `createPostgresStorage(client, options?)` and
    `POSTGRES_STORAGE_SCHEMA: string`. Takes a `pg`-compatible
    client; runs four SQL statements (`SELECT`, two `INSERT ... ON
CONFLICT`, `DELETE`). `pg` is an optional peer dependency on
    `^8.0.0`.
  - Both adapters use minimal structural interfaces (`RedisLike`,
    `PgLike`) so the SDK doesn't import either library at runtime;
    consumers pass any compatible client (including test fakes).
  - See [`docs/storage.md`](./docs/storage.md).
- Shared `Storage` contract test:
  `test/unit/storage/contract.ts` exports a parametrised suite
  that every implementation (`InMemoryStorage`,
  `createRedisStorage`, `createPostgresStorage`) runs against —
  drift between implementations is impossible-to-not-notice.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- **`withRateLimit(client, options?)` decorator + `TokenBucket` /
  `BucketMap` primitives.** Wraps any `WhatsAppLikeClient` and
  throttles `send*` calls at a per-pair bucket (default 1 msg per
  6 s) and a per-WABA bucket (default 80 MPS) before delegating to
  the wrapped client. Caller surface unchanged — the queue is
  invisible. Lower-level `TokenBucket` and `BucketMap` are exported
  for non-WhatsApp use cases. See [`docs/queue.md`](./docs/queue.md).
- New OTel span `whatsapp.queue.acquire` exposes queue latency
  separately from network latency, with PII-redacted recipient /
  WABA attributes.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`TokenProvider` callback for `WhatsAppClient`.**
  `WhatsAppClientOptions.token` now accepts
  `string | (() => string | Promise<string>)`. The SDK resolves the
  callback once per outer request — all retries within a single
  request reuse the same resolved value. Closes the race window in
  the previous "swap the client instance per tenant on
  `AuthenticationError`" rotation pattern. The `TokenProvider` type
  is exported from the root entry. See
  [`docs/client.md`](./docs/client.md) and
  [`docs/patterns.md`](./docs/patterns.md) § 5.
- Provider errors (throw, empty string, non-string return) surface
  as `AuthenticationError` before the HTTP request is made, with
  the underlying error attached as `cause`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (pre-1.0 minor):** the `@internal`
  `WhatsAppClient._getBearerToken(): string` is removed and replaced
  with `WhatsAppClient._resolveBearerToken(): Promise<string>`.
  External callers MUST NOT depend on internal accessors; the legacy
  helper is gone.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`@dojocoding/whatsapp/hono` subpath** — typed Hono `Handler`
  wrapper around the web-standard core. Mount with
  `app.all(path, whatsappHandler(receiver))`. See
  [`docs/hono.md`](./docs/hono.md) and
  [`docs/cookbook/hono.md`](./docs/cookbook/hono.md). Hono is an
  optional peer dependency on `^4.0.0`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`@dojocoding/whatsapp/web` subpath** — Fetch-API
  (`Request → Response`) handler usable on Cloudflare Workers, Bun,
  Deno, Hono, Next.js App Router, and any WinterCG runtime. See
  [`docs/web.md`](./docs/web.md) and
  [`docs/cookbook/cloudflare-workers.md`](./docs/cookbook/cloudflare-workers.md).
- WebCrypto migration of `verifySignature`, `verifyHandshake`, and
  `hashPhoneNumberId` — these now run unmodified on any WinterCG
  runtime in addition to Node. Byte-identical output to the previous
  `node:crypto` implementations, verified by parity tests.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (pre-1.0 minor):** `verifySignature`, `computeSignature`,
  and `hashPhoneNumberId` are now `async`. Internal call sites are
  updated; external callers must `await` the return value.
- **BREAKING (pre-1.0 minor):** `WebhookReceiver.verify` and
  `WebhookReceiver.handlePayload` are now `async`. The return shape
  (`{ status, dispatchPromise }`) is unchanged; the receiver now
  resolves to it via a Promise.
- The Express adapter is now a thin shim over the web-standard core
  (`createWhatsAppHandler`). Externally observable behaviour is
  unchanged; the integration suite passes without modification.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-10

First public release. Eight capability slices, all proposed and merged through
OpenSpec; see `openspec/changes/archive/` for the per-capability proposal,
design, spec deltas, and tasks.

### Added

- **Cloud API client** (`WhatsAppClient`) — HTTP transport with bearer-token
  auth, exponential-backoff retry with full jitter on 408/429/5xx and Meta
  recoverable codes (130429 / 131048 / 131053 / 131056), `Retry-After`
  honouring, token-debug health check, per-instance Graph API version pin.
- **Message builders** — typed builders and `client.send*` convenience methods
  for text, image, video, audio, document, sticker, location, contacts,
  interactive (button / list / cta_url), template, reaction, and reply
  messages.
- **Webhook receiver** (`WebhookReceiver`) — GET-handshake verify-token check,
  raw-body HMAC-SHA256 signature verification with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`,
  polymorphic event parsing (`message`, `status`, `template_status`,
  `template_quality_update`, `template_category_update`,
  `phone_number_quality_update`, `account_alert`, `account_review`,
  `unknown`), `wamid` dedupe through a pluggable `Storage`, and 30-second-ack
  async dispatch.
- **24-hour window tracker** (`WindowTracker`) — pluggable `Storage`-backed
  customer-service window state; `client.send*` throws `WindowClosedError`
  pre-flight when the window is closed. Templates and reactions are
  window-exempt.
- **Template management** — list / get approved templates; 1-indexed
  contiguous `{{N}}` placeholder validation; cross-validation of template
  components against placeholder counts before send.
- **Mock mode** (`MockWhatsAppClient`, `pickWhatsAppClient`) — shared
  `WhatsAppLikeClient` interface with the real client, parity-tested across a
  cross-client matrix. Records sends in memory; optional in-memory template
  registry. No Meta credentials required.
- **Observability** — OpenTelemetry spans on every Graph API request and
  every webhook-handler invocation, with PII-redacting `hashPhoneNumberId`
  (configurable salt via `setRedactSalt`). `@opentelemetry/api` is an
  optional peer dependency.
- **Express adapter** (`@dojocoding/whatsapp/express`) — middleware that
  captures raw bytes before any JSON parser, handles `GET`/`POST` method
  routing, and acks within 30 seconds.
- **Typed error classes** — `WhatsAppError`, `RateLimitError`,
  `WindowClosedError`, `WebhookSignatureError`, `TemplateError`,
  `MissingCredentialsError`, `MockModeError`, `AuthenticationError`,
  `PermissionError`, `CapabilityError`. Branch with `instanceof`, not
  string matching.
- **Storage interface** — `Storage` with TTL semantics and `InMemoryStorage`
  reference implementation. Shared by `WindowTracker` and the webhook
  deduper.

### Compliance

- Graph API pin: `v25.0`.
- Webhook dedupe TTL: 24 hours (covers Meta's up-to-7-day delivery retries
  practically; full 7-day TTL is opt-in via `Storage` config).
- Webhook ack deadline: 30 seconds.

### Project

- Spec-driven via [OpenSpec](https://github.com/openspec-dev/openspec); eight
  stable specs under `openspec/specs/`.
- Dual ESM + CJS build via `tsup`; `Node >= 20` LTS.
- Test layers: unit, contract, integration, parity. Coverage thresholds
  enforced in CI (line ≥ 90 %, branch ≥ 85 %).
